            I've always wanted to be somebody that created things. I had no hand in art and my writing was mediocre at best; but I really enjoyed coding and it really made me
            feel as if I was able to create something that was worthwhile. I am an avid fan of video games, and would probably consider myself a gamer; in saying that, working
            for a gamong company would be my ideal job. But, anything that will allow me to learn, grow, and develop will make me happy
            </p>

            On the personal side I enjoy gaming, snowboarding/skiing, exercising, competing in Spartan Races, and spending time at home with my lady and our cats. 
            I really want to go snowboarding out in the Western United States, Europe, and some other places throughout the world and definitely plan on doing that 
            in the future. I hope to master coding so that I can someday play a game that I created.

            I am an animal lover at heart, and ever since I was young cats have been my favorite. I think I enjoy their reclusiveness because it takes work to earn and keep their trust
            but once you have it they are great and loving animals. Plus, they don't bark.
